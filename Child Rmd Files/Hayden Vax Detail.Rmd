## School-Specific Vaccination Rates  

Schools with at least 80% of their vaccine-eligible population vaccinated are exempt from needing to quarantine students with routine classroom exposures to COVID-19. The table below summarizes vaccination rates for schools in Steamboat Springs School District.  

Data compiled by Routt County Public Health with assistance from Steamboat Springs School District.  				
Limitations:  

1. Vaccination rates are based upon data in the Colorado Immunization Informatino System (CIIS) which may be missing some vaccinations.  
2. Inidividual-level matching is based upon name and date of birth match between school records and CIIS.
