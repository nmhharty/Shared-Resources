## Incidence: Weekly and 14-Day Rolling Average, Calculated Weekly   
This graph provides the 14-day (two week) incidence for Routt County by week. It presents the 2-week number of cases for the most recent completed reporting week (Monday through Sunday).       
**NOTE:** Cases are attributed to a date based upon test collection date, for those who have a test collection date. For those with missing test collection dates, the report date is used.
